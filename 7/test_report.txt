Areas for Improvement:
---------------------
1. Add more test cases for ship placement logic
2. Increase coverage of edge cases in CPU targeting
3. Add integration tests for UI interactions
4. Test error handling scenarios

Note: The coverage exceeds the required 60% threshold for all metrics.
