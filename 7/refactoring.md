# Sea Battle Game Refactoring

## Overview

The original JavaScript implementation of the Sea Battle game has been refactored into a modern TypeScript application. The refactoring focused on improving code organization, type safety, and maintainability while preserving the core game mechanics.

## Major Changes

### 1. TypeScript Migration
- Converted the codebase to TypeScript
- Added type definitions for all game entities
- Implemented strict type checking
- Created interfaces and types for better code documentation

### 2. Code Organization
- Separated concerns into distinct classes:
  - `Game`: Core game logic
  - `UI`: User interface and display
- Moved from global variables to encapsulated class properties
- Implemented proper dependency injection

### 3. Modern JavaScript Features
- Replaced `var` with `const` and `let`
- Implemented arrow functions
- Used template literals
- Utilized array methods (map, filter, etc.)
- Implemented proper class-based architecture

### 4. Testing Infrastructure
- Added Jest testing framework
- Implemented comprehensive unit tests
- Added test coverage reporting
- Created test utilities and mocks

### 5. Code Quality Improvements
- Improved error handling
- Added input validation
- Enhanced code readability
- Implemented consistent naming conventions
- Added proper documentation

### 6. Build System
- Added TypeScript compilation
- Implemented npm scripts for development
- Added proper project configuration

## Technical Details

### Type System
- Created type definitions for:
  - Game state
  - Board representation
  - Ship objects
  - Position coordinates
  - Game configuration

### Class Structure
- `Game` class:
  - Manages game state
  - Handles game logic
  - Processes player and CPU moves
  - Validates game rules

- `UI` class:
  - Handles user input/output
  - Manages game display
  - Controls game flow
  - Provides user feedback

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for:
  - Game initialization
  - Player moves
  - CPU moves
  - Game state management
  - Win condition detection

1. **Type Safety**
   - Reduced runtime errors
   - Better IDE support
   - Improved code documentation

2. **Maintainability**
   - Clear code structure
   - Separated concerns
   - Easy to extend

3. **Reliability**
   - Comprehensive testing
   - Input validation
   - Error handling

4. **Development Experience**
