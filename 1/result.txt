**Requirement Analysis:**

1. Scale Requirements:
   - Millions of users
   - Each user has a profile
   - Users create posts
   - Users form connections (social graph)
   - System must handle growth

2. Performance Requirements:
   - High read speed is critical
   - Read:Write ratio is 80:20
   - Scalability is a primary concern

3. Data Model Requirements:
   - User profiles (structured data)
   - Posts (semi-structured, potentially with media)
   - Social connections (graph relationships)
   - Need for complex queries (e.g., friend-of-friend, feed generation)

**Key Criteria:**

1. Read Performance
   - Must handle high read throughput
   - Low latency for read operations
   - Efficient caching capabilities

2. Scalability
   - Horizontal scaling capability
   - Ability to handle growing data volume
   - Distributed architecture support

3. Data Model Support
   - Flexible schema for evolving requirements
   - Efficient handling of relationships
   - Support for complex queries

4. Operational Requirements
   - High availability
   - Data consistency
   - Backup and recovery capabilities

**Database Comparison:**

Option 1: PostgreSQL
Pros:
- Excellent read performance with proper indexing
- Strong ACID compliance
- Built-in support for JSON/JSONB for flexible schema
- Mature ecosystem and tooling
- Good scalability with read replicas
- Strong community support

Cons:
- Horizontal scaling can be complex
- Graph operations require additional extensions
- May need additional caching layer for optimal performance

Option 2: MongoDB
Pros:
- Excellent horizontal scaling
- Flexible schema design
- Good read performance
- Built-in sharding
- Document model fits well with social data
- Strong community and ecosystem

Cons:
- Weaker consistency guarantees
- Complex transactions
- Graph operations require additional work
- Memory usage can be high

Option 3: Neo4j
Pros:
- Native graph database perfect for social connections
- Excellent for relationship-heavy queries
- Strong consistency
- Good read performance for graph operations
- Built-in graph visualization tools

Cons:
- Less suitable for non-graph data
- Higher operational complexity
- More expensive at scale
- May need additional database for non-graph data

**Recommendation:**

I recommend a hybrid approach using PostgreSQL as the primary database with Redis for caching:

Primary Database: PostgreSQL
- Provides strong consistency and reliability
- Excellent read performance with proper indexing
- JSONB support for flexible schema
- Mature ecosystem and tooling
- Can handle both structured and semi-structured data
- Cost-effective at scale

Caching Layer: Redis
- In-memory caching for frequently accessed data
- Can handle high read throughput
- Supports various data structures
- Can be used for session management
- Helps achieve required read performance

Justification:
1. The 80/20 read/write ratio suggests we need strong read performance, which PostgreSQL can provide with proper indexing and Redis caching
2. PostgreSQL's JSONB support allows for flexible schema evolution while maintaining data integrity
3. The hybrid approach provides:
   - Strong consistency where needed
   - High read performance through caching
   - Cost-effective scaling
   - Mature tooling and community support
4. While Neo4j would be excellent for the social graph aspect, the additional complexity and cost don't justify its use when PostgreSQL can handle the relationships efficiently with proper indexing
5. MongoDB's eventual consistency model might be too relaxed for a social platform where data consistency is important

This solution provides the best balance of:
- Performance (through caching)
- Scalability (through read replicas and sharding)
- Cost-effectiveness
- Operational simplicity
- Data consistency
- Flexibility for future requirements

The system can be scaled by:
1. Adding read replicas for PostgreSQL
2. Implementing sharding for specific tables
3. Scaling Redis clusters for caching
4. Using connection pooling
5. Implementing proper indexing strategies
