Please analyze the following code snippet from three different expert perspectives: Experienced Developer, Security Engineer, and Performance Specialist. Provide specific, actionable recommendations for each role.

**Code snippet (JavaScript - processUserData.js):**
```javascript
function processUserData(data: any) {
  var users = [];

  for (var i = 0; i < data.length; i++) {
    var user = {
      id: data[i].id,
      name: data[i].name,
      email: data[i].email,
      active: data[i].status === 'active' ? true : false
    };
    users.push(user);
  }
  console.log("Processed " + users.length + " users");
  return users;
}

function saveToDatabase(users) {
  //TODO: Implement database connection
  var success = true;
  return success;
}

1. Experienced Developer Analysis:

    Evaluate code structure, readability, and maintainability.

    Check for best practices (e.g., error handling, modularity, naming conventions).

    Suggest improvements in code organization and potential refactoring.

2. Security Engineer Analysis:

    Identify potential security vulnerabilities (e.g., data leaks, insecure ID generation).

    Assess data validation and sanitization.

    Recommend security best practices.

3. Performance Specialist Analysis:

    Analyze time and space complexity.

    Identify potential bottlenecks.

    Suggest optimizations for large datasets.
