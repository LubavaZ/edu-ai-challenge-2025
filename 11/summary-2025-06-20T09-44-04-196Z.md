The patient, a healthy 25-year-old student who works part-time as a postman, presents with sharp chest pain over the heart area lasting a few seconds, recurring over the past three days. The pain worsens with coughing and lying down but improves when leaning forward. There are no associated symptoms like shortness of breath, dizziness, palpitations, or weakness. The patient recently recovered from the flu and has no history of medical conditions, surgeries, or medication use besides occasional Tylenol. The patient is concerned about having a heart attack, especially since their father recently died from one two weeks ago. Lifestyle factors include occasional alcohol use, no smoking or recreational drugs. The healthcare provider plans to perform an ECG and possibly blood tests to assess heart function and reassures the patient to try not to worry while awaiting results.
