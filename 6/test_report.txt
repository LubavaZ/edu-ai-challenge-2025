Implementation Notes
------------------
- All tests pass with the fixed rotor stepping mechanism
- The implementation correctly handles the double-stepping feature
- The encryption/decryption process is consistent and reversible
- The machine preserves non-alphabetic characters as required
- All core functionality is covered by tests
- Test coverage exceeds the 60% requirement

Conclusion
---------
The Enigma machine implementation is now working correctly with proper rotor stepping mechanism. All test cases pass, and the test coverage exceeds the required 60%. The implementation correctly follows all Enigma machine rules and handles all edge cases appropriately.
